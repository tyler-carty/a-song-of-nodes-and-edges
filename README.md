# A Song of Nodes & Edges

This site aims to improve your understanding of the complex and incredibly well written character interactions within the book series "A Song of Ice and Fire", written by George R. R. Martin. The major houses from the series are shown below, each with a colour that will be used in the character network.

The visualisation makes use of the D3.js library to create a network of character interactions and family/friend relationships throughout the book series. This information is based on the ASOIAF Dataset which is available at https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf. The purpose is to improve your understanding of the complexities of the “A Song of Ice and Fire” story line and hopefully educate you on some lesser known characters, and their importance in the story.

A live demonstration of this application is available on this site https://tyler-cartwright.github.io/.
